# Research for vibration motors

## Coin Cell Vibration Motors

These motors are very cheap costing under pound per unit. That operate at 3.3v so can be driven by the Arduino output pins without any
current boosting.The downside to these motors is that they are very cheaply made hence the manufacturing of the motors is very poor and 
they do have a tendancy to vibrate themselves apart

## Dual Shock 3 Rumble Motors

The motors perform well. They have a good vibration and are manufactured to a high standard. However the motors are quite expensive in 
comaparsion to the cell motors and are also much larger which could cause problems with the compactness of our final product.
